## Flask Framework Architecture
This site was built using [Flask micro framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/foreword/#what-does-micro-mean).

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions
